CipherOS is a Android Custom OS, Based On AOSP
That is striving to Provide its Users , A Clean , Bloat free & Sturdy Experience with Minimal Customisation ! (Thats all pretty normal huh?)
The newer version that is 4.0+ is based on Android 13(Tiramisu) and heavily inspired by RealmeUI
Now here is how to install CipherOS on your device :

1. For general devices THAT DON'T HAVE Dynamic Partitons and is A only (You can know it by your device community. There is always one for every device)
1.1 Download CipherOS via https://cipheros.github.io/ (Official devices) For unofficial devices see it on XDA or device community
1.2 Proceed to boot to a working recovery (i.e TWRP,OFRP,PBRP and SHRP) assuming you have one for this. I heavily reccomend you refer to your device community for information. In this case i am using TWRP i reccomend you use it also
1.3 Backup data if you feel so *OPTIONAL* (Go to BACKUP tab and tick Data and backup)
1.4 Format your device data (Wipe > Format Data > Type yes)
